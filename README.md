# Forecasting Whitepaper

I recently wrote a whitepaper at [statworx](https://www.statworx.com/en/) focusing on forecasting. In this paper, I delve into various methods, their applications, and best practices for tackling forecasting challenges. Despite the wide range of methods available for forecasting, this whitepaper is designed to provide a broad overview of different approaches and use cases.

PDF files are available within the repo but you can also download it via statworx:

Our whitepaper explores the transformative potential of forecasting for companies. From traditional statistical models to modern deep learning approaches – the methods and benefits are diverse.

In the whitepaper, we address the following topics, among others:

- Fundamentals and technical implementation of forecasting
- Diversity of forecasting methods and their application
- Practical examples of successful implementations
- Solutions for common challenges such as exogenous shocks and new product launches
